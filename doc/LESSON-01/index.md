Add configuration to support app for different viewports.  We're developing for a laptop or desktop computer, but games can also be created that work on mobile devices as well.

	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<style>
			html, body {
				margin: 0;
				padding: 0;
			}
		</style>
		<title>Phaser3 + Parceljs Template</title>
	</head>

Add some text to the <body> tag content and see the browser window automatically update.  Remove your added content when done.

Create new Game object.  We'll be replacing the default.
